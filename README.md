I completed the project using Python in Visual Studio Code, following all the required tasks. 
I developed an object-oriented file sorting system that scans a selected folder and organizes the files based on their extensions.
The application uses shutil to move files into categorized folders, and logs each move (source, destination, and timestamp) for tracking and undo purposes.
I implemented a simple GUI with tkinter that allows the user to select a folder and start or stop the sorting process. 
The program also includes error handling for name conflicts and permission issues. Additionally, I added an undo function that restores moved files based on the saved history.
